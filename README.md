This is a simple and quick webpage I created using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to demonstrate my skills, sticking only to vanilla code. This means I strayed away from using front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap. I wanted to demonstrate that I have a solid understanding of fundamentals and layouts.

I wanted to add some dynamic functionality to the website using Javascript; my client code retrieves weather information from a weather API and displays it accordingly. This project was strictly front-end.

No AI was used.
